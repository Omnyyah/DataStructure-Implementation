# Data Structure Implementation

## Why this repository?

A week ago I watched a course about the main and most used data structures, and because it's one of the most important aspect of any programmer knowledge,
I want to share a simple and easy to understande implementaion of the main data structures that I wrote during the course using Java language, and a small application of each one.
