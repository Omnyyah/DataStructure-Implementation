# Data Structure Implementation

## Why this repository?

A week ago I watched a course about the main and most used data structures, and because they are one of the most important aspect of any programmer knowledge,
I want to share a simple and easy to understande implementaion of the main data structures using Java language, and sample applications of each one.
